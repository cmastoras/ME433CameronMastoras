black, 1991, “It was once said by a man who couldn’t quit, dope—”
black, 1991, “Ice Cube writes the rhymes that I say”
black, 1991, But now, since he stepped the fuck off

black, 1991, Looking like straight Bozos
black, 1991, I saw it coming, that's why I went solo
black, 1991, And kept on stompin'
black, 1991, While y'all mothafuckers moved straight outta Compton
black, 1991, Living with the whites
black, 1991, One big house and not another nigga in sight
black, 1991, I started off with too much cargo
black, 1991, Dropped four niggas now I'm making all the dough

black, 1991, Who gives a fuck about a punk-ass villain?
black, 1991, You're getting fucked real quick
black, 1991, And Eazy's dick is smelling like MC Ren's shit
black, 1991, Tried to tell you a year ago

black, 1991, I couldn't stop you from getting ganked
black, 1991, Now let's play big-bank-take-little-bank

black, 1991, 'Cause I heard you like giving up the drawers
black, 1991, Gang-banged by your manager, fella
black, 1991, Getting money out your ass like a mothafucking Ready Teller
black, 1991, Giving up the dollar bills
black, 1991, Now they got The Villain with a purse and high-heels
black, 1991, So don't believe what Ren say
black, 1991, 'Cause he's going out like Kunta Kinte
black, 1991, But I got a whip for ya, Toby
black, 1991, Used to be my homie, now you act like you don't know me
black, 1991, It's a case of divide-and-conquer
black, 1991, 'Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
black, 1991, House nigga gotta run and hide
black, 1991, Yelling Compton, but you moved to Riverside
black, 1991, So don't front, MC Ren
black, 1991, 'Cause I remember when you drove a B-210
black, 1991, Broke as a mothafucking joke

black, 1991, Eazy-E turned faggot
black, 1991, With your manager, fella
black, 1991, Fucking MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella
black, 1991, But if they were smart as me
black, 1991, Eazy-E a'be hanging from a tree
black, 1991, With no vaseline
black, 1991, Just a match and a little bit of gasoline
black, 1991, Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on
black, 1991, Till that Jheri curl is gone
black, 1991, On a permanent vacation
black, 1991, Off the massa plantation
black, 1991, Heard you both got the same bank account
black, 1991, Dumb nigga, what you thinking bout?!
black, 1991, Get rid of that Devil real simple
black, 1991, Put a bullet in his temple
black, 1991, 'Cause you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew
black, 1991, With a white jew telling you what to do
black, 1991, Pulling wools with your scams
black, 1991, Now I gotta play the Silence of the Lambs
black, 1991, With a midget who's a punk, too
black, 1991, Tryin' to fuck me, but I'd rather fuck you
black, 1991, Eric Wright, punk, always into something
black, 1991, Gettin' fucked at night
black, 1991, By Mista Shitpacker
black, 1991, Bend over for the goddamn cracker
black, 1991, No vaseline
black, 1991, Mothafuckin' nosejob having ass
black, 1991, Mothafucking Jheri Curl lite
black, 1991, Ambi wearing mothafuckin' bitch
black, 1992, Break 'em
black, 1992, Yeah
black, 1992, Yeah
black, 1992, Yeah
black, 1992, Uh
black, 1992, Just wakin' up in the morning, gotta thank God
black, 1992, I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
black, 1992, No barking from the dog, no smog
black, 1992, And Momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
black, 1992, I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
black, 1992, Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
black, 1992, Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
black, 1992, Thinkin', "Will I live another twenty-four?"
black, 1992, I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
black, 1992, And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
black, 1992, Had to stop at a red light
black, 1992, Lookin' in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
black, 1992, And everything is alright
black, 1992, I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
black, 1992, Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
black, 1992, "Which park are y'all playin' basketball?"
black, 1992, Get me on the court and I'm trouble
black, 1992, Last week, fucked around and got a triple double
black, 1992, Freakin' niggas every way, like MJ
black, 1992, I can't believe today was a good day
black, 1992, Drove to the pad and hit the showers
black, 1992, Didn't even get no static from the cowards
black, 1992, 'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
black, 1992, Saw the police and they rolled right past me
black, 1992, No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
black, 1992, As I ran the intersection
black, 1992, Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
black, 1992, What's the haps on the craps?
black, 1992, Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
black, 1992, Roll 'em in a circle of niggas
black, 1992, And watch me break 'em with the 7, 7-11, 7-11
black, 1992, 7, even back door Little Joe
black, 1992, I picked up the cash flow
black, 1992, Then we played bones, and I'm yellin': "Domino!"
black, 1992, Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central LA
black, 1992, Today was a good day
black, 1992, Left my nigga's house paid
black, 1992, Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
black, 1992, It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
black, 1992, The Lakers beat the Supersonics
black, 1992, I felt on the big fat fanny
black, 1992, Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
black, 1992, And my dick runs deep, so deep
black, 1992, So deep put her ass to sleep
black, 1992, Woke her up around one
black, 1992, She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
black, 1992, Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
black, 1992, Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
black, 1992, I was glad everything had worked out
black, 1992, Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
black, 1992, Today was like one of those fly dreams
black, 1992, Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
black, 1992, No helicopter lookin' for a murder
black, 1992, Two in the morning, got the Fatburger
black, 1992, Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
black, 1992, And it read "Ice Cube's a Pimp"  Yeah 
black, 1992, Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
black, 1992, Halfway home and my pager still blowin' up
black, 1992, Today I didn't even have to use my AK
black, 1992, I gotta say, it was a good day
black, 1992, Hey, wait, wait a minute!
black, 1992, Pooh, stop this shit!
black, 1992, What the fuck am I thinkin' about?
black, 1994, Yeah, yeah
black, 1994, Ayo, Black—it's time, word  Word, it's time, man 
black, 1994, It's time, man  Aight, man, begin 
black, 1994, Yeah—straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
black, 1994, Where fake niggas don't make it back
black, 1994, I don't know how to start this shit, yo—now;
black, 1994, Rappers; I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm
black, 1994, I be kickin', musician inflictin' composition
black, 1994, Of pain, I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
black, 1994, Holdin' an M16, see, with the pen I'm extreme
black, 1994, Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
black, 1994, I'm suited up with street clothes, hand me a 9 and I'll defeat foes
black, 1994, Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
black, 1994, I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
black, 1994, Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
black, 1994, Laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps
black, 1994, G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
black, 1994, Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
black, 1994, Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
black, 1994, Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
black, 1994, Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and
black, 1994, I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
black, 1994, Picked the MAC up, told brothers "Back up!" — the MAC spit
black, 1994, Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him back-flip
black, 1994, Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
black, 1994, Gave another squeeze, heard it click, "Yo, my shit is stuck!"
black, 1994, Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
black, 1994, Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
black, 1994, So, now I'm jettin' to the buildin' lobby
black, 1994, And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be
black, 1994,  So, what you sayin'?  It's like the game ain't the same
black, 1994, Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
black, 1994, And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
black, 1994, In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us
black, 1994, .45’s and gauges, MAC's in fact
black, 1994, Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks
black, 1994, In black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
black, 1994, So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
black, 1994, I know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock
black, 1994, And if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots
black, 1994, But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
black, 1994, Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
black, 1994, It drops deep as it does in my breath
black, 1994, I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
black, 1994, Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
black, 1994, I think of crime when I'm in a New York State of Mind
black, 1994, New York state of mind
black, 1994, New York state of mind
black, 1994, New York state of mind
black, 1994, New York state of mind
black, 1994, Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TEC's
black, 1994, Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
black, 1994, Investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
black, 1994, Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops
black, 1994, But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
black, 1994, Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
black, 1994, I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
black, 1994, Give me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin'
black, 1994, Thinkin' of cash flow, Buddha and shelter
black, 1994, Whenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta
black, 1994, In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
black, 1994, Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
black, 1994, Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
black, 1994, From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
black, 1994, Black, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black
black, 1994, The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back
black, 1994, And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
black, 1994, Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
black, 1994, I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
black, 1994, Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain
black, 1994, And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
black, 1994, Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages
black, 1994, It's only right that I was born to use mics
black, 1994, And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
black, 1994, I'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
black, 1994, My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
black, 1994, The smooth criminal on beat breaks
black, 1994, Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
black, 1994, The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
black, 1994, That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
black, 1994, I'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers
black, 1994, In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
black, 1994, Inhale deep like the words of my breath
black, 1994, I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
black, 1994, I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times
black, 1994, Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind
black, 1994, New York state of mind
black, 1994, New York state of mind
black, 1994, New York state of mind
black, 1994, New York state of mind
black, 1994, "Nasty Nas—"
black, 2001, Fuck Jay Z!

black, 2001, I got this locked since '91, I am the truest
black, 2001, Name a rapper that I ain't influenced
black, 2001, Gave y'all chapters, but now I keep my eyes on the Judas
black, 2001, With Hawaiian Sophie fame, kept my name in his music
black, 2001, Check it

black, 2001,  Lose  I prove you lost already
black, 2001, I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten
black, 2001, Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten
black, 2001, Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave
black, 2001, Talk about me, laugh behind my back, but in my face
black, 2001, Y'all some well-wishers, friendly-acting, envy-hiding snakes
black, 2001, With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?
black, 2001, When these streets keep callin', heard it when I was sleep
black, 2001, That this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef
black, 2001, Started cockin' up my weapon, slowly loadin' up this ammo
black, 2001, To explode it on a camel and his soldiers
black, 2001, I can handle this for dolo, and his manuscript just sound stupid
black, 2001, When KRS already made an album called Blueprint  Dick! 
black, 2001, First Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say
black, 2001, That you better than B.I.G
black, 2001, Dick-suckin' lips, why don't you let the late great veteran live?
black, 2001, I… will… not… lose
black, 2001, God's son across the belly
black, 2001, I prove you lost already

black, 2001, Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
black, 2001, What's sad is I love you, ‘cause you're my brother
black, 2001, You traded your soul for riches
black, 2001, My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
black, 2001, And now I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it
black, 2001, You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women
black, 2001, Were you abused as a child?
black, 2001, Scared to smile? They called you ugly?
black, 2001, Well, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me
black, 2001, Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
black, 2001, In '88 you was gettin' chased through your building
black, 2001, Callin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
black, 2001, All I did was give you a style for you to run with
black, 2001, Smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the God
black, 2001, Wearin' Jaz' chains, no TECs, no cash, no cars
black, 2001, No jail bars, Jigga, no pies, no case
black, 2001, Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase
black, 2001, You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan

black, 2001, Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
black, 2001, Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy
black, 2001, Rocafella died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
black, 2001, And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?

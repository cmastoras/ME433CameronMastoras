black, 2013, [Intro: Chance The Rapper]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, igh
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, igh

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Okie dokie, alkie, keep it low-key like Thor lil' bro
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilin' like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack, in an hour I'll ash my lucky
Tonight she just yelling "Fuck me"
Two weeks she'll be yelling "Fuck me"
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh, generation above me, I know you still remember me
My afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting, blam
[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank (Innanet)
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Innanet)
(Kisses, kisses)

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere, they be asking how's it going
Say the going's well, go figure, Victor's light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God
God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, checkmate, check me, take me to the bedroom
Like she know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel shit
Shit-faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L
Elevated, train, and the craziest thing
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it
Probably shoulda been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe, thumpin' that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong
Rip, brain-dead, take a tug and then pass
[Bridge: Vic Mensa]
I think we all addicted
Yeah, I think we all addicted
Really though, I think we all addicted (Yah)
I think we all addicted

[Chorus 2: Vic Mensa]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I think we all addicted (Kisses, kisses)

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
[Verse 3: Twista]
I could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter, juicy
Used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie
I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi
You see, I be still a God but a goofy
You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi
That's the dual principle, sometimes I'ma be about some hoes
Sometimes I'ma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson (Yeah)
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
'Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope, see (What?)
Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm off of codeine, low key
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what I miss is
I'ma end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking
I need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug, and I can't 'cause I'm stanking
Never too old for a spanking, IGH!
[Chorus 2: Vic Mensa]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I think we all addicted (Kisses, kisses)

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
You old Petey Pablo, take your shirt off
Wave 'round your head like a helicopter
I ain't put enough weed in the blunt
All you do is smoke tobacco
Where the hell you get them from?
Yeezy said he ain't make them
My niggas chasin' bounty hunters
And gettin' chased by their baby mamas
My first tat was on my stomach
Got a pocket full of money (Money)
And a mind full of ideas
Some of this shit may sound weird
Inside of the Maybach
Look like it came out of Ikea
Run shit like diarrhea (True)
Big yacht, no power steering (Yeah)
Aye, aye, captain (Ooh!)
I'm high, captain (A-alright!)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I got problems bigger than these boys, yeah

Lord, free the Carter, niggas need the Carter
Sacrificin' everything, I feel like Jesus Carter
Hold up, I got this sewed up, my soda poured up
My woes up, I'm flippin' those bucks, they doing toe tucks
I rolled up and let the smoke puff
I lay down, toes up
Hold up, get too choked up when I think of old stuff
Move on, put my goons on, they kidnap newborns
In the streets my face a coupon
Her pussy too warm
All these bitches come to do harm
Just bought a new charm
Fuck the watch, I buy a new arm, you lukewarm
I'm Uncle Luke with the hoes
Pretty bitches, centerfolds
Tippy toes around my crib in they robes, just their robes
Half a milli' in the safe, another in the pillowcase
Codeine got me movin' slower than a caterpillar race
Fuck wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?
What you thought it was?
I just popped five Percocets and only caught a buzz
And if that label try to stop me
There gon' be some crazy Weezy fans waitin' in the lobby
Mula, baby

You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bih
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, huh, haha

black, 2013, [Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Chance, acid rapper, soccer, hacky sacker
Cocky khaki jacket jacker
Slap-happy faggot slapper, bah-bah
Iraqi rocket launcher
Shake that Laffy Taffy, jolly raunchy rapper
Dang, dang, dang, skeet, skeet, skeet
She do that thing for three retweets
The album feel like '92
Now take that ball 'fore he three-peat
Chance, ho, acid, cruising on that LSD
Asked Joseph about my deal
He looked back said, "Hell yeah, let's eat"

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
This shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words
But I still fuck with you, you just ain't never heard

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Young Rascal Flatts, young ass kid ass could rap
Fuck all the faculty, tobacco-packing acrobat
Back-to-back packin' bags back and forth with fifths of Jack and
Fourths of weed, I'm back to pack on hands
With young Cletus to pat my back
Real nigga with a nose ring, that's right
Just here to rap them songs
Rag on my hair, wrap weed in Vegas, rockin' Vagabonds
Sang a song, oh, you don't know? What?
Well, I still bang with you
Hang with you, sip drank with you
As long as I can sang with you like

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
Niggas, please be focused, that Bino, you know this
He rep the home of Sosas, you know I'm from that Zone 6
You know I rep that Stone shit, you know your hood is so clit
As God as my witness, this Will Smith spit real shit
I'ma be that, CG busy gettin', where the weed at?
Bought your girl some new kneepads
You're fuckin' with the Fifi bag
My stars, egad, she said, "This my favorite song"
"Hold my purse", now she on the floor, droppin' like it's hot
You blast this shit in Abercrombie when your work is finished
Your mom won't play it in the car 'cause it got cursing in it
Your boy like, "I'm the one who showed you"
He want his percentage
'Cause you were like, "This ain't the nigga you said spittin', is it?"
Two-step, white dude's Harlem Shake
Why you laughing? 'Cause you Harlem Shake
I was never fake, I was just too good to be true
That's acid rap, we killed the track
You had your chance, and 'Bino too, ooh
[Chorus: Chance The Rapper & Childish Gambino]
This shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words
But I still fuck with you, you just ain't never heard
It go like, count that stack, pop that cap then down that Jack
All my niggas hit that xan, and all my ladies bob that back

black, 2016, [Intro: Jean Deaux]
Got it, I got it, oh
Say what you're looking for, 'cause I got it, yeah, ayy
I got it, I got it, oh
I got it, yeah

[Hook: Jean Deaux]
Oh yes I made it alive, Lake Shore Drive, headed to paradise
In this moment of mine, I can't recognize
Or see that the glare is bright
And what you compromise, I almost died
I doubt the water is red as mine

[Verse 1: Saba]
Ayy, how you lonely in a room with God?
Never slow up, not even a pit stop
Praying my niggas'll never get caught
Overcame it all, like I'm some big shot
Was taught to be a man, up to the wrist watch
To the collar shirt tucked, with the front pocket
Part of adolescence when they go blossom
When your stars align, I hope there's no comet
So far it's...
Oh yes, I made it alive, on the West Side
Still at my momma house
The kids on my conscience now
'Cause the youth dying and it's just more common now
Common ground, stuck through it all like we Carmelo
Comin' down, high off of life, arrive unannounced
Summonin', numbin' the pain of when I'm in doubt, high school
My head in the clouds, like I learned about
[Hook: Jean Deaux]
Oh yes I made it alive, Lake Shore Drive, headed to paradise
In this moment of mine, I can't recognize
Or see that the glare is bright
And what you compromise, I almost die
I doubt the water is red as mine

[Post-Hook: Jean Deaux & Saba]
What are you looking for?
I got it (I got it)
I got it (I got it)
All the things you adore
I got it (I got it)
I got it (I got it)

[Verse 2: Saba]
Runnin' through my city like a tour bus
Hopin' one day I can have a tour bus
I can see the planets from my window sill
And I tend to tell what is honest
I don't wanna fight no one, no contest
I just wanna undress my conscience
I just met a killer that's bent in his ways
Try to raise a family with minimum wage, what can I say?
Besides the demons, it's reality for the people that we love
And we are the ones that will team up and tee up the party
Dead end the school, bet that they'll show up real tardy
The audience awfully ready and rowdy
I meant it if I said it, you get in writing
Got into a science, but write with the lightning
Like soil, I'm grounded, the seed has just sprouted
[Hook: Jean Deaux]
Oh yes I made it alive, Lake Shore Drive, headed to paradise
In this moment of mine, I can't recognize
Or see that the glare is bright
And what you compromise, I almost die
I doubt the water is red as mine

[Post-Hook: Jean Deaux & Saba]
What are you looking for?
I got it, I got it (show what you want)
I got it, I got it (show what you want)
All, the things you adore
I got it, I got it (show what you want)
I got it, I got it (show what you want)
Show what you want, show what you want
Show what you want, show what you want

[Outro: Billy Williams]
I just wanna be the plug so my people can eat
I just wanna play soccer on rooftops in Tokyo
I just wanna find somewhere I don't gotta put a face on for people no mo'
Yours truly, Billy Williams
black, 2018, [Part 1: "BUSY"]

[Verse 1]
I'm so alone, but all of my friends—
But all of my friends got some shit to do, yeah—all 'em got plans
I call 'em, I'm bad at texting, they never cross me like bad pedestrians
I've been this awkward since adolescence, I don't know how long I had depression
Never no peer-pressure, I'm tryna' get my little pecker off in some girl
I call my BFF, that ain't no secret kept, I fucked then told my cousin
I'm broke, I wasn't buzzin', I tried to hit a few years, she wasn't budgin'
I'm bogus, left my girl for some shawty, surely deservin' of all this lonely
"You sad? Tell me, how are you sad? You got all of these friends, you got all of these fans", I ain't trust nobody new since 2012, I ain't let nobody in
Jesus got killed for our sins, Walter got killed for a coat
I'm tryna cope, but it's a part of me gone—in a packed room, I'm alone

[Chorus: Saba & Daoud]
I'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away
I seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe
I'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away
I seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe
Ohhh, ohhh

[Verse 2: Saba]
I'm so alone, just me and my girl
She leave me for work, then leave me for school, she finally home—I leave her for tour
FaceTime me nudity, yeah, all of this new to me, yeah
All of the infidelity when I was 17 been catchin' up
It still feel like she'll catch me cheatin'
Niggas askin' me how tour was
Knowin' I been home like two months
And I seen your ass like two times
Save the small-talk like two dimes
No time, social interaction
Had female friends I found attractive
I tried to fuck but I am no savage
Now we don't speak, we just walk past
If my past could talk
It'd probably reply to the missed calls after all
'Cause the friendships that I can't recall
Done turned my heart into camouflage
While the guys I used to play basketball with
Doin' shit that I can't endorse now
With the Lord now, when it pours down
Was alone then, still alone now
[Chorus: Saba & Daoud]
I'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away
I seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe
I'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away
I seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe
Ohhh, ohhh
[Verse 3: theMIND]
I'm barely here, how I ain't present?
Yeah, I drift for a second, forgot to reply to your message
But all these years
I been the same in your presence (I'm still here)
Countin' the seconds before I reply to your message
My biggest fear (is that I have to say goodbye another time)
Is that I have to say goodbye another time
(Not like this, not like this, not like this)
So I skip town on our moment, hopefully prolonging this
I don't need nobody new to miss
(Not like this)
I want you to know
Ooooh, ooh-ooh
Ohh

[Part 2: "SIRENS"]

[Chorus: Saba]
Sirens on the way, aye
Now you're lying where the angels lay
Yeah, sirens on the way, aye
Now we're lying where the angels lay
Yeah, sirens on the way, aye
Now you're lying where the angels lay
Yeah, sirens on the way, aye
Now we're lying where the angels—yeah
[Verse]
Ridin' through the city
I'm young, I'm black, I'm guilty
I know one time wanna kill me
They don't know me but they fear me
15 years old with the sticky
They gon' blame it on the marijuana
Hands behind your head
And they won't let up out they lead
But if I move that's disrespect
But if they shoot then that's just that?
And if I run then that look bad?
Drawing they gun right off their hip
I'm probably deservin'
'Cause I know they serve and protect
But they think I'm servin'
Or they think my cellphone's a weapon
Heard that the robber wore a black mask
I fit the description, a.k.a. "nigga"
What is the difference? It's an enigma
We so divided, I'm from Division
Clutch that purse cause of my dreadlocks
Cross that street cause I'm with my friends
Curse every song in hip-hop
Keep telling yourself it's all fair
[Chorus]
Sirens on the way, aye
Now you're lying where the angels lay
Yeah, sirens on the way, aye
Now we're lying where the angels lay
Yeah, sirens on the way, aye
Now you're lying where the angels lay
Yeah, sirens on the way, aye
Now we're lying where the—
black, 2018, [Part I: "PROM"]

[Verse: Saba]
This remind me of before we had insomnia (Right)
Sleeping peacefully, never needed a pile of drugs
Everybody was college-bound
No dollar amounts, in God we trust
Senior year, my prom ain't had no party bus
My cousin hit me on Facebook like, "What shorty you taking?"
I'm lying, I'm playing, I'm saying I got one to take and I'm waiting on her response
Wrote her a three-page letter
It's three days later, never hit me back—she broke my heart
So now he IM'ing me shit like, "Yo, is shorty bad?"
I pretend not to be depressed she never wrote me back
I hit him back like "Yo, well fuck her, it's on to the next"
I wrote that message thinking, "I'm awkward, pro'lly never have sex"
You know in high school, sixteen, you pro'lly late
My cousin hit me back: "Don't trip, bro, I got you a date"
So he sent me this link to some girl I had never seen
He said to call and tell her, "Walter sent you, you with me"
I think about it for a minute, like, "What's his intentions?"
I mean, we never really got along or used to kick it
In fact, if I remember—vividly—he picked on me
He used to beat me up and take my sneakers every family visit
I'm skeptical to let her know I'm Walter little cousin
What if this shit all a joke? Then again, what if it wasn't?
Would I really risk the chance of me potentially fucking on some stranger daughter
'Cause I barely know if I can trust him?
Pro'lly not
I finally call her, tell her, "Walter sent me, my name Tahj"
She ask me, "What's the color scheme that we gon' wear to prom?"
I'm acting like I'm not excited, tryna play it off
"So what's the car we taking?" Worst come worst, her mom can take us
I call Walt to thank him; he said "Don't trip and just wear black"
He said she cool and they go back—if any problems, hit him back
I never had to; but now, we in tune
He Facebook message me like, "Sorry, not to be a nuisance"
But he like thirty dollars short on all his prom suit shit
I'm like, "I got you, cuz—that's the least that I could do"
He tell me, send him the addy, and he'll slide after school
I'm like, "Okay, bet," never knew where he stay at
He walk down the street, hella surprised—"This where y'all place at?
Uncle Carl, Auntie Deborah, my cousin 'Rina?"
And I'm surprised, too; my family knew, kept this a secret
Me and Cuz stayed down the street, living different lives
Every day, he on the bus; me, I get a ride
I gave him thirty on the porch, he never went inside
He tells me, "Thank you," then he walk back home with a smile
He tryna hide it, but I see his dimple
I'm thinking, "Damn, that transaction was simple"
I'm talking shit, I know he hoop, I'm like, "Ayy, where the rim, bro?"
He like, "Tomorrow, if you free—you pro'lly weak as shit, though"
I know my brother not
So all three of us went to the park and ran some niggas off the court
I'm hella passive, I was passing, I ain't have to score
The next day the prom, I couldn't sleep, I stayed up
My granddad gave me a condom, then walked away, didn't say nothing
She hopped out of a car and said that her name was Jada
My heart's racing, I'm focused, I'm tryna keep it player
Gave her the croissant or corsage or whatever the fuck
My mom handed me, and said, "Now put it on her hand, Malik"
Family ties, my grandfather taught me how to tie up a tie 'cause my dad lived in NY
That's prolly why I was shy, so self-conscious
Took pictures on the porch and then we headed for the prom, and
Walter went on prom the same day, but to a different place
So he text me, like, "Cuz, this the spot, let's meet up later
And bring Jada through"; prom flashed, I kept it cool
We show up to the function, wait, she brought a change of clothes
I'm looking around, like, "Damn, I don't know nobody"
We at this party out west, and Jada left to get dressed
I fake like I'm sending texts; some stranger get really close
I swear that I hear his breath, then he put a knife to my neck
Gave me the rundown like, "Jada my sister
And if you hit her, fuck her, make her miss you, I'ma kill you"
At this point, I'm just exhausted, wondering, "Where the fuck's Walter?"
He shows up like 30 minutes after our altercation
I never mention it to him, he kinda overprotective
And I know if I tell him that he'll beat this nigga's skull in
Turn his body a skeleton, and our night'll end terrible
I exhale and say, "Fuck it," and I just chose to let it go
[Part II: "KING"]

[Skit]
Fuck with your boy
Said you're used to getting everything your way
This not how that happens this time
She tryna fuck with your boy

[Verse 1: Saba]
Walt went to St. Louis, had a full ride for his hoopin'
Him and his coach got into it, now he back home doing music, ayy
I was at Columbia, a damn-near straight-A student
I had one B in a hip-hop class, I thought that shit was stupid
He transferred to Robert Morris, always live, we down the street
My class let out at 2:40 and his class let out at 3:00
Mama asked me where the hell I been at, where the hell I be
"I'm with Walter, Ma, I'm safe," I keep walking in here late
I might fall off in your bae, I get girls now, I get laid
I get caught up following Walter, I'm a product of my age
He talk to every girl downtown Chicago, wingman, I cannot fly though
He was in Cal-white Impala, he was that nigga in the party
Awfully popular for someone that they barely mention
Plus, we from the part of city that they barely mention
Just logged into Twitter, and somehow, we was barely mentioned
We signed our name on the open mic list and then they skipped us
And then they skipped us again like a week later
Like, "Obviously, this fucking host can't read the paper"
Hella intimidating, a big guy, didn't have to flex
So Walter walked to the host and said, "This the name you callin' next"
Bullied our way to the stage and then overstayed our welcome
An apple never get too far from the tree that it fell from
Just like my father, tryna do music and hope I make it
Walter joined me for the journey, said, "The city waiting"
PIVOT
[Break: inaudible dialogue]

[Verse 2: Saba]
Walter invincible, dodged death like a mad magician
More times than a mathematician
I'm in L.A. working on Bucket List Project
I get a call and get a fishy feeling
Normally, Walt joke on the phone; this time, he overserious
My heart dropping—I'm like, "Yo, what is it?"
He say he with T-Y on the highway, and some niggas just tried to kill him
Emptied the clip on the car, but somehow, they didn't hit him
Sometimes, I fucking hate Chicago 'cause I hate this feeling
Innocent niggas get shot at in the broad day, the a.m.
I asked him for a play-by-play of how their whole day went
He say he went to XSport and they ran a full-court
And I cannot retort without thinking that this can't be the reason
"So what else you do? What about Ty? Is he still cool?
Where you on your way from, and where you on your way to?"
He say he just left a dinner at a friend crib, and that's it
He say, "Ty don't do shit but smoke—honestly, Saba, that's it"
Give him sympathy, another case of mistaken identity
The news pro'lly gon' run this as two gangs from different streets
Police questioning him like he just shot at a trooper
My boy walked away unharmed, and we did Lollapalooza, yeah
Six months pass by, every day, we celebrate, every day, a better day
I just dropped Bucket List, Walt about to drop a tape
Everything going perfect, couldn't paint a better way
PIVOT Gang is on the way
We just sold out Lincoln Hall, then I went to talk to Sway
I got back home and got back on it 'cause Walt was doing two-a-days
Sending me links to songs that he made
Kid Cudi, we are not riding no waves, ayy
Grandma made his plate, we played 2K, that's just a day before
Fatimah got a show tomorrow, he text me, "Ayy, we in that hoe"
I went to the barbershop the first thing the next morning
Then I got up with LEGIT, we supposed to do some recording
Ten minutes into the session, I got a call from a number that I don't got saved, but I answer anyways
She says, "Hello, Malik, have you or Squeak
Talked to my son today? He was just on the train"
We got in the car, but we didn't know where to drive to
Fuck it, wherever you are, my nigga, we'll come and find you
[Outro: John Walt]
Just another day in the ghetto
Oh, the streets bring sorrow
Can't get up today with their schedule
I just hope I make it 'til tomorrow
I just hope I make it 'til tomorrow—
I just hope I make it 'til tomorrow—
I just hope I make it 'til tomorrow—

any place\nThe way he smelled,the way he smiled\nThe evil she even recognized as a child\nHand on her throat, sting of a fist\nInstead of her first kiss she got this\nShameful feeling, painful secret\nLonely knowin' that nobody would believe it\nEvery wound that escapes her time capsule\nHurts like the day it was born and it's brand new\n\n[Refrain]\nI wasn't there babygirl but I'm here\nI

shrine one piece at a time\nE & K made it all fade away\nColors don't burn no more it's all gray\nCan't find heaven from within that shell, but it's enough of a blessing if just not seen

you demand of me\nI'm learning to embrace the reality\nThat life doesn't always turn out how it's planned to be\nI didn't deserve what was handed me\nOnly one who can grant happiness is me\nWhat it
